  stmt.run("Claude E. Boyd", "Auburn University | AU · School of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences, Phd", "Acidity :In book: Water Quality (pp.215-231)", "From what I've learned, acidity in water bodies with a pH ranging from around 4 to 8.3 is mainly due to carbon dioxide and dissolved humic substances. When the pH drops below 4, it usually indicates the presence of sulfuric acid or another strong acid, though CO2 and humic compounds are still present. This low pH level often means low productivity and biodiversity in the water. To measure acidity, they use titration with standard sodium hydroxide, and it's usually reported in milligrams per liter of calcium carbonate. Low pH levels and high acidity can occur naturally, often due to the oxidation of sulfides in soil or sediment. But human activities like mining and burning fossil fuels also contribute to this acidity in surface waters. Interestingly, while rising atmospheric CO2 levels don't drastically change the pH of rainfall and freshwater bodies, they are leading to ocean acidification, which is harming calcifying organisms. Liming is a common method used to neutralize acidity.", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335797110_Acidity");

This makes microbiological control and monitoring of the water crucial. In a study conducted in Ahvaz city, Iran, over a six-month period, researchers collected 18 water samples from different points in the hemodialysis water distribution system. They discovered a high number of bacterial colonies on R2A agar, and using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, identified 31 different bacteria with diverse morphological and biochemical traits. Most of the bacteria were Gram-negative bacilli, with Sphingomonas being the most commonly isolated genus. Interestingly, despite the presence of these Gram-negative bacteria, the endotoxin levels in all samples were below the detection limit. The study concluded that bacteria from the Sphingomonas genus, along with Bosea and mycobacteria, are likely early colonizers that form biofilms on surfaces. These, along with other bacteria like Pelomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Staphylococcus, and Microbacterium, could pose potential health risks to hemodialysis patients.", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382559089_Potentially_pathogenic_culturable_bacteria_in_hemodialysis_waters");

Ultrafiltration is crucial for removing contaminants and ensuring clean water. This study presents a novel hybrid machine learning approach that enhances ultrafiltration processes for more effective contaminant removal. By integrating eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with Bayesian optimization, we developed highly accurate predictive models (R² > 99%) for post-treatment levels of metal ions, organic pollutants, and salts. This method allows precise control of the ultrafiltration process through four key variables: metal ion concentration, organic pollutants, salts, and applied pressure. The findings highlight the potential of this approach to revolutionize wastewater treatment, leading to cleaner water and advancing environmental technology.","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382795972_From_data_to_clean_water_XGBoost_and_Bayesian_optimization_for_advanced_wastewater_treatment_with_ultrafiltration");

This study evaluates the microbial stability of a city's water distribution system over a year, focusing on variations in microbial counts across different points of use. The highest bioburden was observed in autumn, with some locations exceeding the 10,000 CFU/100 mL threshold, indicating potential issues related to distance, pipe type, or biofilms. An early warning system was established to monitor these surges. The study found that some sections of the distribution system showed less variation in microbial levels, while significant differences were observed between high and low microbial count areas. This suggests the need to review the distribution infrastructure design to ensure water safety. The findings provide valuable insights for public health management, helping authorities identify and address areas at risk for waterborne diseases.","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381803923_Enhancing_microbiological_stability_in_municipal_water_distribution_A_descriptive_statistical_analysis_for_public_health_assurance");
